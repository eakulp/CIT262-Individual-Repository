# Hello, I'm Eymi Kulp

I live in Los Angeles, California with my husband Josh and my dog Wolfie. I’m a marathon runner, and I love to travel.  
My Favorite scripture is Luke 9:24, “For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it”.
